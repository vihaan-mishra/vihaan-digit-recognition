# vihaan-digit-recognition

## What:
This is a digit recogntion project using neural networks and loading the MNIST dataset with keras in tensorflow. Keras is an API for neural networks. 

##  Where:
I did this project in jupyter notebook.

## When:
I completed this project a few weeks ago.

## Why:
I did this as a starting project for machine learning and neural networks. I can now move on to using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) model which will give me improved accuracy and help me learn an important type of machine learning.

## How:
Using neural networks and the MNIST dataset, I created a sytem of testing and training data. By having layers that condensed the possible digits from the image I trained the model and it ended up getting 96 percent accuracy. I then used the testing data and got an accuracy of 97 percent.
